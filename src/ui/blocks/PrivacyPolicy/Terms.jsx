      <p>
        Section 23 of these Terms contains an arbitration agreement and class
        action waiver that apply to all claims brought against Teache in the
        United States. Please read them carefully.
      </p>
      <p>Last Updated: January 30, 2022</p>
      <p>Thank you for using Teache!</p>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service (“<span>Terms</span>”) are a binding legal
        agreement between you and Teache that governs your use of the websites,
        applications, and other offerings from Teache (collectively, the “
        <span>Teache Platform</span>”). When used in these Terms, “
        <span>Teache</span>,” “<span>we</span>,” “<span>us</span>,” or “
        <span>our</span>” refers to the Teache entity, set out on Schedule
        1, with whom you are contracting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Teache Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“
        <span>Members</span>”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services.
        Members who publish and offer services are “<span>Instructors</span>”
        and Members who search for, book, or use services are “
        <span>Users</span>.” Instructors offer classes (“<span>Classes</span>”)
        and other services (collectively referred to as “
        <span>Instructor Services</span>;” each individual Instructor Service
        offering is referred to as a “<span>Listing</span>”). You must register
        an account to access and use many features of the Teache Platform, and
        you must keep your account information accurate. As the provider of the
        Teache Platform, Teache does not own, control, offer, or manage any
        Listings or Instructor Services. Teache is not a party to the contracts
        concluded directly between Instructors and Users, nor is Teache an
        insurer. Teache is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any
        Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of Service (“
        <span>Payment Terms</span>
        ”). To learn more about Teache’s role, see Section 16.
      </p>
      <p>
        We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms, such
        as our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of
        personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment services
        provided to Members by the Teache payment entities.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are an instructor, you are responsible for understanding and
        complying with all laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third
        parties that apply to your Instructor Services.
